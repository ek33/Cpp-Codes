titanium dioxide nanomaterials are widely considered to be the photocatalysts for environmental protection and energy conversion
the low photocatalytic efficiency caused by large bandgap and rapid recombination of photoexcited electrons and holes is a challenging issue that needs to be settled for their practical applications
structure engineering has been demonstrated to be a highly promising approach to engineer the optical and electronic properties of the existing materials or even endow them with unexpected properties
